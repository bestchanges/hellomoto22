There is an project idea.
BestMine it is a miner software for mining altcoins.

The main features:
1. automatic switch to the most profitable currency
2. auto conversion income to BTC and withdraw

It is kind of how nicehash working but expected to have 10-25% more profit.

1. how it works
* From client it like installation of single application like nicehash does.
* After startup in make benchmark for all supported algorithms and calculates target hashrate.
* when it start mining the most profitable coin on public pool.
* all mining revenue will be automatically converted from altcoin to Bitcoin.
* detailed statistics, management and monitoring are available on single web dashboard.
* daily payments in BTC

2. Why is the most profitable?
Our profit module will constantly monitor coins net parameters and exchange rates.
When it detected the most profitable combination of Coin, Pool and Exchange it direct rig farm to this coin.
When the pool send earned coins they will be converted to BTC on exchange.

3. Why it is expected more profit when nicehash does?
Because nicehash has trading platform for hashrate behind it.
So the miner's revenue at least lower for the buyer revenue.
We are instead will mine directly to the best coin directly.

4. What about short term Pump And Dumps?
This strategy works exactly fine with pumps and dumps.
When exchange rate pumps for short period we are (all miners from service) can quickly mine and exchange while it is profitable.
When it doesn't we just switch off taken what we already converted.

D you like this idea? Do you need such service?

PS: we are run our service in beta. You can request invitation here:
